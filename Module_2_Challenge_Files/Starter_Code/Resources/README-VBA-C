Documentation of my process to complete the VBA - Challenge:

Conceptual Framework I began by asking the Xpert Learning Assistant AI.
Prompt 1: I'm starting the module 2 challenge and need help with VBA scripting basics
Prompt 2: [Inserted Assignment Instructions]

Answer Generation 1 (Substantial): Explained what concepts and tools from module 2 I should have learned to complete the assignment.

I had cleared that using AI is ok as long as provide explanation on how I generated and created my code.

AI Change--> chatGPT4
I went to chatGPT and uploaded the file and the assignment instructions.
It was not using the method from class and not even using VBA so I decided to do a quick pivot.
The code was not functioning.

AI Change --> Perplexity Ai
Did not allow for file upload.

Prompt 1: [Inserted Assignment Instructions] + must be completed in VBA
-code generated- (Too much to work with)

I decided that to goal set what I wanted the AI to achieve and break it down to make that achievement likely
  a. Uses the concepts we learned in class
  b. readable/reasonable code that was understandable and useable for reference later
  c. separate the functionalities of the code into 3 modules to make debugging easier

Prompt 2: [Inserted the Xpert Learning Assitant Answers of how this assignment is supposed to be completed]
(better but not enough)

Prompt 3: Inserted [1st 1/3 of instructions] +  [Congratulations on completing Module 2]
(Code runs with bugs)

Prompt 4: Debug at line x error "type mismatch"
(wasn't working)

AI Change --> ChatGPT4
Prompt: [Inserted code] + Debug "mismatch issue dateValue = ws.Cells(dataRow, 2).Value"
with some fiddling this help me fix this issue

Prompt: Debug runtime error '13' type mismatch
(Didn't work)

I did some fiddling around with changing data types variable assignments and it finally worked the first section of code!

Completed part 1/3

AI Change --> Xpert learning assistant
Prompt: how to complete conditional formatting portion. 

AI Change --> Perplexity

Prompt: Inserted [2/3 of instructions] +  [Answer from Xpert learning assistant]
(Code runs near perfect but incomplete)
some  minor debugging to my code

Prompt: Inserted [Debugged code] + [Conditional Formatting rubric] + described where certain columns are in my sheets
(Works perfect!)

Completed part 2/3

Prompt: [Calculated Values instructions] + [Calculated values rubric]
(runs but number are wrong and not matching)

Prompt: Debug at line x "runtime error 91. Object variable or with block variable not set. ws.Cells(2, 16).Value = tickerRange.Cells(increaseTickerCell.Row - 1, 1).Value"
(New issue tickers not populating)
(New issue incorrect ticker values)

Discovered that since some are stored as percentages it messes with my numbers and I ask it to fix it but the AI generated fixes were too cumbersome.
Realize that all the numbers were overshot by 100 so I hard coded to multiply by .001. 
Completed 3/3

Thank you for reviewing my processes.
