Documentation of my process to complete the VBA - Challenge:

Conceptual Framework I began by asking the Xpert Learning Assistant AI.
Prompt 1: I'm starting the module 2 challenge and need help with VBA scripting basics
Prompt 2: [Inserted Assignment Instructions]

Answer Generation 1 (Substantial): Explained what concepts and tools from module 2 I should have learned to complete the assignment.

I had cleared that using AI is ok as long as provide explanation on how I generated and created my code.

AI Change--> chatGPT4
I went to chatGPT and uploaded the file and the assignment instructions.
It was not using the method from class and not even using VBA so I decided to do a quick pivot.
The code was not functioning.

AI Change --> Perplexity Ai
Did not allow for file uploaded. 
I decided that to goal set what I wanted the AI to achieve and break it down to make that achievement likely
  a. Uses the concepts we learned in class
  b. readable/reasonable code that was understandable and useable for reference later
  c. separate the functionalities of the code into 3 modules to make debugging easier

Prompt 1: [Inserted Assignment Instructions] + must be completed in VBA

Prompt 2: [Inserted the Xpert Learning Assitant Answers of how this assignment is supposed to be completed]
